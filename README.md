## Hi there, I'm Marvin :wave:

I'm a software engineer working in the (cloud) infrastructure space. I currently work at [Kubermatic](https://github.com/kubermatic).

- You can find my personal website and blog at <a rel="me" href="https://marvin.beckers.dev">marvin.beckers.dev</a>
- I sometimes publish on the Fediverse via <a rel="me" href="https://hachyderm.io/@embik">@embik on hachyderm.io</a>

### Projects

I maintain a couple of personal open source projects that you might find interesting:

- [kubeconfig-bikeshed](https://github.com/embik/kubeconfig-bikeshed): A kubeconfig manager with support for labels and pruning outdated kubeconfigs, among other things.
- [kubectl-ephemeral](https://github.com/embik/kubectl-ephemeral): A simple `kubectl` plugin to launch [ephemeral containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/ephemeral-containers/).
- [hugo-theme-lyla](https://github.com/embik/hugo-theme-lyla): A compact Hugo theme based on [mvp.css](https://github.com/andybrewer/mvp), used for my personal website.

### Repositories

Some of those projects (and tools I use) are available from package repositories I operate:

- A [Homebrew tap](https://github.com/embik/homebrew-tap) for macOS users.
- A [krew index](https://github.com/embik/krew-index) for kubectl plugins.
